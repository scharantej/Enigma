 ### Problem Analysis

The problem is to build a web application that has a collection of interesting mystery stories. The application should allow users to read the stories, search for stories by title or author, and add new stories to the collection.

### Design

The application will be built using the Flask microframework. The following HTML files will be used:

* `index.html`: The home page of the application. This page will display a list of all the stories in the collection.
* `story.html`: A page that displays a single story.
* `search.html`: A page that allows users to search for stories by title or author.
* `add.html`: A page that allows users to add new stories to the collection.

The following routes will be used:

* `/`: The home page.
* `/story/<id>`: A page that displays a single story.
* `/search`: A page that allows users to search for stories by title or author.
* `/add`: A page that allows users to add new stories to the collection.

### Implementation

The following code shows the implementation of the Flask application:

```python
from flask import Flask, render_template, request, redirect, url_for

app = Flask(__name__)

stories = []

@app.route('/')
def index():
    return render_template('index.html', stories=stories)

@app.route('/story/<id>')
def story(id):
    story = stories[int(id)]
    return render_template('story.html', story=story)

@app.route('/search', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def search():
    if request.method == 'POST':
        title = request.form['title']
        author = request.form['author']
        stories = [story for story in stories if story['title'] == title or story['author'] == author]
    return render_template('search.html', stories=stories)

@app.route('/add', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def add():
    if request.method == 'POST':
        title = request.form['title']
        author = request.form['author']
        story = request.form['story']
        stories.append({'title': title, 'author': author, 'story': story})
        return redirect(url_for('index'))
    return render_template('add.html')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

### Testing

The application can be tested by running the following command:

```
python app.py
```

The application will then be available at http://localhost:5000.
